KwisStandalone
==============

This is an alpha build.  Use at your own risk.


After compiling, open the KwisStandalone executable.  A notification icon will be located in you system tray to turn off
the application when you are done.

Gestures will work once you are in the Video section of WMC. See the wiki for details on gestures (coming soon!).

You need a Creative Interactive Gesture Camera for this to work at all.

Known Issues:
The application behaves erratically if Windows Media Center is not open.


KwisCapture is also included.  It is a utility that creates a bitmap of a gesture sutible for the main application
